# HCC Machine Learning Course 2024 Spring

This repository contains the Machine Learning materials used for in-class practice in the Human Centric Computing Class (HCC) at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU).

## Lab1 - Pokemon Recognition
In this lab, we will perform Pokemon image recognition using `scikit-learn`.

## Lab2 - Deep License Plate Recognition
In this lab, we will perform license plate recognition using a simple Convolutional Neural Network.

## Lab3 - Objection Detection: YOLOv7
In this lab, we will perform object detection from scratch using YOLOv7.
